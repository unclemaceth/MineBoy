## üí° QUICK REFERENCE

**Most Useful Queries:**

1. **See all recent messages:**
   ```sql
   SELECT message, wallet, message_type, TO_TIMESTAMP(created_at/1000) FROM paid_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
   ```

2. **Find messages with keyword:**
   ```sql
   SELECT message, wallet FROM paid_messages WHERE message ILIKE '%keyword%';
   ```

3. **Top spenders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT wallet, SUM(CAST(amount_wei AS NUMERIC))/1e18 as ape FROM paid_messages GROUP BY wallet ORDER BY ape DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Queue status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM paid_messages GROUP BY status;
   ```

5. **Today's revenue:**
   ```sql
   SELECT message_type, COUNT(*), SUM(CAST(amount_wei AS NUMERIC))/1e18 as ape FROM paid_messages WHERE created_at >= EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW())*1000 - 86400000 GROUP BY message_type;
   ```

**üîç Pro Tips:**

- Use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive search
- Timestamps are in milliseconds, divide by 1000 for seconds
- `amount_wei` is stored as TEXT, cast to NUMERIC for math
- Wallet addresses are stored lowercase
- Use `TO_TIMESTAMP(created_at/1000)` for readable dates
- Add `LIMIT` to large queries for performance
