All security hardenings complete. All tests created. Ready to deploy.

---

## 🔒 Security Invariants (Verified)

| Invariant | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Caller is immutable per session** | Heartbeat + Claim checks | ✅ |
| **Locks keyed by vault (owner)** | SessionStore uses effectiveOwner | ✅ |
| **EIP-712 includes caller** | EIP712_TYPES_V3_1 | ✅ |
| **Smart contract validates ownership** | Router ownerOf check | ✅ |
| **Backend ignores client caller** | Uses session.caller only | ✅ |
| **Rewards mint to hot wallet** | Router mints to claimData.caller | ✅ |
| **Multipliers from vault's NPCs** | calculateMultiplier(session.owner) | ✅ |

```

**Smart Contract:**
```bash

## 🧪 Testing

### **Foundry Contract Tests**

Location: `contracts/test/MiningClaimRouterV3_1.t.sol`

```bash
# Run tests
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract RouterV31_E2E -vvv

# Expected:
✓ testHappyPath_DelegatedClaim_MintsToHot
✓ testRevert_WrongCaller
✓ testRevert_VaultDoesNotOwnNFT
✓ testRevert_ExpiredClaim
✓ testRevert_NonceReuse
```

### **Backend API Tests**

Location: `packages/backend/test/delegate-flow.spec.ts`

```bash
# TODO: Add to package.json test script
npm test -- delegate-flow.spec.ts

# Tests:
✓ Session open with delegation
✓ Heartbeat from original caller (success)
✓ Heartbeat from different caller (403)
✓ Claim preimage validation
✓ Security invariants
```

### **Manual Smoke Tests**

Location: `test-delegate-smoke.sh`

```bash
# Run smoke tests
./test-delegate-smoke.sh

# Tests:
✓ Open delegated session
✓ Heartbeat from hot1 (success)
✓ Heartbeat from hot2 (403 caller_changed)
✓ Session remains valid after blocked attempt
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### **Key Security Events**

Add these to your monitoring dashboard:

```bash
# Critical Security Events
[SECURITY] caller_mismatch    # Hot wallet swap attempt
[SECURITY] owner_mismatch      # Ownership lock conflict
[SECURITY] lock_missing        # Missing ownership lock

# Metrics to Track
security.caller_mismatch       # Counter
security.owner_mismatch        # Counter
security.lock_missing          # Counter
claim_revert_ownerOf           # On-chain reverts (parsed from receipts)
```

### **Alert Thresholds**

```bash
⚠️  caller_mismatch > 5/hour     # Possible attack or bug
⚠️  owner_mismatch > 10/hour     # Lock contention issues
⚠️  claim_revert_ownerOf > 20/hour  # Users transferring NFTs mid-mine
```

### **Grafana/Datadog Queries**

```bash
# Caller mismatch events
fields @timestamp, sessionId, expectedCaller, receivedCaller
| filter @message like /SECURITY.*caller_mismatch/
| sort @timestamp desc

# Owner mismatch events
fields @timestamp, sessionId, expectedOwner, lockOwner
| filter @message like /SECURITY.*owner_mismatch/
| sort @timestamp desc
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **1. Commit & Push**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: V3.1 delegate system with immutable caller security"
git push origin B
```

### **2. Deploy Backend (Render)**

- Auto-deploys from git push
- Wait ~2 minutes for build
- Verify logs show no errors
- Check `/health` endpoint

### **3. Deploy Frontend (Vercel)**

- Auto-deploys from git push
- Wait ~1 minute for build
- Verify build success
- Check `/` loads correctly

### **4. Run Smoke Tests**

```bash
# Test backend API
./test-delegate-smoke.sh

# Expected output:
✅ PASS: Session opened successfully
✅ PASS: Heartbeat accepted from original caller
✅ PASS: Correctly blocked different caller (403 caller_changed)
✅ PASS: Session remains valid with original caller
```

### **5. Test Frontend Flow**

```bash
1. Connect hot wallet (0x46Cd...)
2. Auto-detect vault (0x9091...)
3. Load vault's cartridges
4. Select cartridge, start mining
5. Mine and claim
6. Verify:
   - Rewards → hot wallet ✓
   - Multipliers shown ✓
   - No 409 errors ✓
```

### **6. Monitor for 1 Hour**

```bash
# Watch logs for:
- No caller_mismatch events (unless intentional test)
- No owner_mismatch spikes
- Claims processing normally
- No unexpected 403/409 errors
```

## 🎯 Post-Deploy Validation

### **End-to-End User Flows**

**Scenario 1: Happy Delegated Flow**
```
1. Vault delegates to hot wallet at delegate.xyz
2. Connect hot wallet to MineBoy
3. Auto-detect vault address ✓
4. Load vault's cartridges ✓
5. Select cartridge, mine ✓
6. Claim → rewards to hot wallet ✓
7. Multipliers from vault's NPCs ✓
```

**Scenario 2: Hot Wallet Swap Attempt**
```
1. Start session with hot1
2. Change delegation to hot2 at delegate.xyz
3. hot2 tries to mine same session
4. Result: 403 caller_changed ✓
5. hot2 must open new session ✓
```

**Scenario 3: NFT Transfer Mid-Session**
```
1. Start mining with delegated session
2. Transfer NFT from vault to new owner
3. Try to claim
4. Result: Transaction reverts "Not cartridge owner" ✓
```

**Scenario 4: Multiple Hot Wallets (Same Vault)**
```
1. Delegate vault to hot1 AND hot2
2. hot1 opens session ✓
3. hot2 tries to open session
4. Result: 429 session limit ✓
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Technical Metrics**

```bash
✓ 0 caller_mismatch events (unless testing)
✓ 0 owner_mismatch spikes
✓ <1% claim failure rate
✓ <100ms heartbeat response time
✓ 100% delegation verification success
```

### **User Experience**

```bash
✓ Users can delegate and mine
✓ Rewards mint to hot wallet
✓ Multipliers display correctly
✓ No unexpected errors
✓ Clear error messages if issues
```

## 🛡️ Security Posture

### **Attack Vectors: CLOSED**

| Attack | Prevention | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hot wallet swap | Immutable caller | ✅ BLOCKED |
| Multi-hot farming | Vault-keyed locks | ✅ BLOCKED |
| Cross-user theft | Backend signature | ✅ BLOCKED |
| Work stealing | Preimage binding | ✅ BLOCKED |
| NFT transfer | On-chain ownerOf | ✅ REVERTS |
| Delegation revocation | Smart contract | ✅ SAFE |

### **Defense in Depth**

```
Layer 1: Backend session locks (vault-keyed)
  ↓
Layer 2: Immutable caller enforcement
  ↓
Layer 3: Backend EIP-712 signature
  ↓
Layer 4: Smart contract validation (ownerOf + caller)
  ↓
Layer 5: On-chain nonce + expiry checks
```

## 📞 Support Playbook

### **Common Issues**

**Issue: "caller_changed" error**
```bash
Cause: User trying to mine from different hot wallet
Fix: Close session, open new session with new hot wallet
```

**Issue: "Not delegated" error**
```bash
Cause: Delegation not set up or expired
Fix: Go to delegate.xyz and set up delegation
```

**Issue: Claim reverts "Not cartridge owner"**
```bash
Cause: NFT transferred during session
Fix: Close session, re-open with new owner
```

**Issue: Multipliers not showing**
```bash
Cause: Vault has no NPCs
Fix: Normal - multiplier only shows if >1.0x
```
