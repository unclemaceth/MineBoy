# X API Integration - Complete Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

You now have **TWO separate X posting systems**:

### 1. **Flywheel Bot** (Trading Stats)
- Posts daily NPC trading stats
- Location: `packages/flywheel-bot`
- Schedule: **00:00 UTC** (midnight)
- Content: Buys, sales, burns, gas, APE balances

### 2. **MineBoy Backend** (Game Stats)
- Posts daily game metrics
- Location: `packages/backend`
- Schedule: **12:00 UTC** (noon)
- Content: Claims, miners, leaderboard, teams

## Architecture Decision ‚úÖ

**Backend was the right choice** for game stats because:
- ‚úÖ Has access to game database (claims, users, teams)
- ‚úÖ Separate from trading operations
- ‚úÖ Independent deployments
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

## Commits

1. **`94b2162`** - Flywheel bot X integration
2. **`ad8e554`** - MineBoy backend X integration

## What Happens Next

### Render Auto-Deploy
Both services should auto-deploy since you pushed to the main branch:
- Flywheel bot will redeploy
- Backend will redeploy

### Check Logs

**Flywheel bot logs should show:**
```
[X] Client initialized
[DailySummary] Scheduling daily summary at 0:00 UTC
[DailySummary] Next summary in X.X hours
```

**Backend logs should show:**
```
[X:MineBoy] Client initialized
[MineBoy:DailySummary] Scheduling daily summary at 12:00 UTC
[MineBoy:DailySummary] Next summary in X.X hours
```

## Timeline for First Posts

**Today at midnight UTC (00:00):**
- Flywheel bot posts trading stats

**Today at noon UTC (12:00):**
- Backend posts MineBoy game stats

## Example Tweets

### Flywheel (midnight)
```
MineBoy Daily: 2025-10-09

Buys: 12 (245.6 APE, avg 20.5)
Sales: 10 (289.3 APE, +17.8%)
MNESTR burned: 1250000

42 active miners
567 total miners

üèÜ Top: 0x1234...5678 (123 APE)

```

## Testing

**Flywheel bot:**
```bash
cd packages/flywheel-bot
npm run test:x
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run test:x
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Test scripts will actually post to X!

## Environment Variables

Both services use the **same credentials** (already set in Render):
```
X_API_KEY=xxxxx
X_API_SECRET=xxxxx
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxx
X_ACCESS_SECRET=xxxxx
```

## Rate Limit Usage

**Free tier:** 500 posts/month

**Your usage:**
- Flywheel: 1/day = ~30/month
- Backend: 1/day = ~30/month
- **Total: ~60/month (88% unused!)**

## Files Created/Modified

### Flywheel Bot
```
‚úÖ packages/flywheel-bot/src/utils/twitter.ts (new)
‚úÖ packages/flywheel-bot/src/utils/dailySummary.ts (modified)
‚úÖ packages/flywheel-bot/src/utils/discord.ts (fixed TS error)

```

## Verify Deployment

1. **Check Render Dashboard:**
   - Go to both services
   - Verify they're deploying
   - Check "Latest Deploy" shows the new commits

2. **Check Logs:**
   - Open logs for both services
   - Look for `[X] Client initialized` (flywheel)
   - Look for `[X:MineBoy] Client initialized` (backend)

3. **Wait for Scheduled Posts:**
   - Midnight UTC: Check @mineboy_app for flywheel stats
   - Noon UTC: Check @mineboy_app for game stats

## Troubleshooting

### "X API not configured"
- Environment variables not loaded
- Check Render environment settings
- Manually redeploy if needed

### No tweets posted
- Check rate limits in logs
- Verify app has "Read and Write" permissions
- Check X API status

### Wrong account posting
- Verify access token is for @mineboy_app account
- Regenerate tokens if needed

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [ ] Flywheel bot shows `[X] Client initialized`
- [ ] Backend shows `[X:MineBoy] Client initialized`
- [ ] First flywheel tweet at midnight UTC
- [ ] First game stats tweet at noon UTC
- [ ] Both tweets appear on @mineboy_app timeline

## Next Steps

Once verified working, you can:
- Monitor rate limits in logs
- Adjust posting times with env vars
- Add more metrics to tweets
- Create threads for longer updates
- Post special announcements manually
