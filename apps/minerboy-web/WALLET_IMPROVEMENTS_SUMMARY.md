# Wallet Connection Improvements - Summary

## Changes Made

All changes have been implemented to make MineBoy's wallet connection flow more stable and predictable.

### 1. ✅ Manual wagmi Config (No Auto-Connect)
**File:** `src/lib/wallet.ts`
- Replaced `defaultWagmiConfig` with manual `createConfig`
- Added explicit connectors: `walletConnect` and `injected`
- Set `autoConnect: false` to prevent flicker on page load
- Added `ssr: true` for proper server-side rendering

### 2. ✅ Idempotent Web3Modal Initialization
**File:** `src/app/W3MInit.tsx`
- Added `useRef` to ensure Web3Modal is initialized only once
- Added `enableOnramp: false` and `themeMode: 'dark'` options
- Improved guard against double-initialization with both `once.current` and `window.__w3mInited`

### 3. ✅ Improved WalletConnect Bridge
**File:** `src/components/WCAccountBridge.tsx`
- Added `useRef` to track last address and prevent unnecessary updates
- Added `watchChainId` watcher for chain changes
- Improved cleanup with proper unsubscribe functions
- Reconciles state once on mount, then watches for changes

### 4. ✅ SSR Guard in Active Account Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useActiveAccount.ts`
- Added `ready` state that flips on mount to prevent hydration mismatches
- Returns safe defaults during SSR (`address: undefined`, `isConnected: false`)
- Removed verbose debug logging

### 5. ✅ Fixed Wallet Client Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useActiveWalletClient.ts`
- Now uses `useConnectorClient` from wagmi for WalletConnect
- Removed dependency on `window.ethereum` as primary source
- Falls back to `window.ethereum` only if connector client unavailable
- Properly handles both Glyph and WalletConnect signers

### 6. ✅ Removed Storage Wipe from Normal Flow
**File:** `src/components/WalletConnectionModal.tsx`
- Removed call to `removeStaleWalletConnect()` from normal connect flow
- Storage is no longer nuked on every connect
- Function remains available for manual debug use if needed
- Modal now auto-closes via `isConnected` effect instead of closing before open

### 7. ✅ Created Chain Guard Component
**File:** `src/components/WCChainGuard.tsx` (new)
- Optional component that ensures WalletConnect users are on ApeChain
- Attempts silent chain switch after WalletConnect connection
- Non-blocking - doesn't interrupt user flow if switch fails

### 8. ✅ Updated Layout Provider Order
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Kept Thirdweb wrapper (used for PayEmbed functionality)
- Provider order: `ThirdwebProviderWrapper` → `GlyphWalletProvider` → `W3MInit` → `WCAccountBridge` → `WCChainGuard` → `children`
- Added `WCChainGuard` component to layout

## Testing Checklist

To verify these improvements work correctly:

### Cold Load Tests
- [ ] Page loads without wallet flicker or double-initialization
- [ ] No console errors about duplicate Web3Modal instances
- [ ] Address does not flash/change unexpectedly

### WalletConnect Flow
- [ ] Click "WalletConnect" button
- [ ] Select wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)
- [ ] Address appears in UI
- [ ] Modal auto-closes after connection
- [ ] Refresh page - address persists
- [ ] No double-mount flicker on refresh

### Glyph Flow
- [ ] Click "Connect with Glyph" button
- [ ] Complete Glyph auth flow
- [ ] Address appears in UI
- [ ] Modal auto-closes
- [ ] Glyph connection is prioritized over WC

### Disconnect Flow
- [ ] Disconnect via unified disconnect
- [ ] Store clears properly
- [ ] Web3Modal session closes
- [ ] Can reconnect without issues

### Signing Transactions
- [ ] WalletConnect signing uses correct provider (not MetaMask inject if WC connected)
- [ ] Glyph signing works normally
- [ ] Chain switches to ApeChain automatically for WC (or prompts user)

### Mobile Deep Link
- [ ] Deep link back from wallet app resumes connection
- [ ] Bridge updates store correctly
- [ ] No duplicate connection attempts

## Technical Notes

### Key Improvements
1. **No autoConnect**: Prevents race conditions and flicker
2. **Idempotent init**: Web3Modal and bridges initialize once and only once
3. **Correct provider source**: WalletConnect uses `useConnectorClient` instead of `window.ethereum`
4. **SSR safe**: All hooks guard against hydration mismatches
5. **Clean unsubscribes**: All watchers properly unsubscribe on unmount
6. **No storage nuking**: Normal flow doesn't clear localStorage

### Provider Priority
When multiple wallets are connected:
1. Glyph (if connected) takes priority
2. WalletConnect (external) used as fallback
3. Bridge reconciles state on every mount

### Debug Helper
The `removeStaleWalletConnect()` function in `WalletConnectionModal.tsx` is kept for debugging purposes but not called during normal connect flow. If needed for testing, it can be called manually or exposed in a debug panel.

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/wallet.ts` - Core wagmi config
2. `src/app/W3MInit.tsx` - Web3Modal initialization
3. `src/components/WCAccountBridge.tsx` - WC ↔ Store bridge
4. `src/hooks/useActiveAccount.ts` - Unified account hook
5. `src/hooks/useActiveWalletClient.ts` - Unified signer hook
6. `src/components/WalletConnectionModal.tsx` - Connection modal
7. `src/components/WCChainGuard.tsx` - **NEW** Chain enforcement
8. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Provider composition

## Next Steps

1. Test in development using the hot reload
2. Test all wallet connection flows per checklist above
3. Test on Vercel preview deployment
4. Test mobile deep linking flows
5. Monitor for any console warnings or errors
6. If all stable, deploy to production
